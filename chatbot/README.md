# Notes:
1. Some lecture slides have images that do not appear on OfficeLibre but appear in Word Documents. Please make sure when working with slide material that you can see these images
2. Assignments are done by chapters, and there was no homework for chapter 6 and chapters 10 - 19. Check syllabus to get an idea of what the class might have been doing at this time
