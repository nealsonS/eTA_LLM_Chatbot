# Testing Node Backend
First, make sure the latest version of node.js is installed. \
If not, install it at https://nodejs.org/en/download/current \
\
Then in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This command installs all required dependencies

### `node server.js`

Backend should be running on [http://localhost:3800]. Now refresh your front end at [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.
