Coronavirus is a type of virus.

1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,660
The one we're all talking about is new and it causes the disease called COVID-19.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,780
Now most people will only be mildly affected by it,

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,700
but it can kill.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,840
It starts by infecting our upper respiratory tracks, which are

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,420
the most serious cases,

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,660
people can die from the coronavirus.

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,080
This is because the immune system can go into overdrive and that can lead to organ failure. So we need to do what we can to stop this virus from spreading.

So we need to do what we can to stop this virus from spreading.

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,580
As it gets into your body by breathing it in or through your eyes and mouth,

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,160
the best thing to do is wash your hands regularly and properly for at least 20 seconds,

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,800
catch your colds and sneezes in a tissue

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,600
and avoid touching your face.
