Coronavirus is a type of virus.

1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,600
The one we're all talking about is new and it causes the

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,540
disease called COVID-19.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,900
Now most people will only be mildly affected by it,

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,600
but it can kill.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,940
It starts by infecting our upper respiratory tracks,

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,020
which are the airways from your nose

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,680
just above your vocal cords.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,880
You may develop a fever as your immune system starts to fight the virus

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,240
and a dry cough.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,900
That's one where you don't produce any slim.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,380
The virus can then spread to the lungs,

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,260
making it harder for people to breathe

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,920
and it can cause pneumonia.

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,120
In the most serious cases,

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,120
people can die from the coronavirus.

16
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,260
This is because the immune system can go into overdrive and that

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,680
can lead to organ failure.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,140
So we need to do what we can to stop this virus from spreading.

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,540
As it gets into your body by breathing it in or through your eyes and mouth,

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,780
the best thing to do is wash your

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,160
hands regularly and properly for at least 20 seconds.

22
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,420
Catch your colds and sneezes in a tissue and avoid touching your face.
