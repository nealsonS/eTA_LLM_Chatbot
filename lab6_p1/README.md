Script Brief Overview

NOTE TO TEAM: Please don't edit app.py directly with your code! 
Make a copy and work on your part, then we'll piece them together 
afterwards (trying to avoid merges and collisions)

Before running these code, make sure to install the following packages:
- pip install streamlit
- pip install python-dotenv
- pip install langchain
- pip install -U langchain-community
- pip install -U langchain-openai


To run the code, go into the drive folder and run
"streamlit run app.py"
