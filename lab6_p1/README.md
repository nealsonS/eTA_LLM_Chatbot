Script Brief Overview

*****
NOTE TO TEAM: Please don't edit app.py directly with your code! 
Make a copy and work on your part, then we'll piece them together 
afterwards (trying to avoid merges and collisions)

Before running these code, make sure to follow all of the instructions in the README in /drive!

To run the code, go into the /drive folder and run
"streamlit run app.py"
